- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CiaranEnglish

- :mortar_board: I am a Computer Science & Software Engineering student in Maynooth University.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in various hobbies including music, art, design, sport, cooking and of course all things tech!
- :desktop_computer: My major area of interest for work is frontend development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about robotics and computer vision, and am working on my final year research project revolving around integrating nerfstudio capabilities with a Sawyer robot.
- :black_nib: At the moment I'm also working on a browser piano for a group project which will display a piano in the users browser which they can play. We also plan to add the ability to record and edit audio as well as allowing users to put various effects on the piano for some insteresting sounds!
