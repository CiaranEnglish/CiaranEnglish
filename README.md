- 👋 Hi, I’m @CiaranEnglish

- :mortar_board: I am a Computer Science & Software Engineering student in Maynooth University.
- 👀 I’m interested in various hobbies including music, art, design, sport, cooking and of course all things tech!
- :desktop_computer: My major area of interest for work is frontend development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about robotics and computer vision, and am working on my final year research project revolving around integrating nerfstudio capabilities with a Sawyer robot.
- :black_nib: At the moment I'm also working on a weather API which will display the forecast of a city the user searches for. The goal of the project will be to have an app that provides a more pleasant and aesthetic user experience than traditional weather apps.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at ciaran.english.2020@mumail.ie
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- :world_map: Irish
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a weird obsession with supermarkets (mainly Tesco) and can probably navigate any store blindfolded.
